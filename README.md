# Fitness Tracker Project Overview and Reflections
# Project Overview:
The provided HTML file represents a Fitness Tracker web application designed to help users track their fitness activities, set goals, monitor water intake, toggle between light and dark themes, and submit their weekly meal plans. Here's a breakdown of the project elements:

# HTML Structure:
The HTML file provides the basic structure of the web page, containing various div elements to organize different sections of the application.
Elements such as buttons, input fields, headings, and lists are utilized for user interaction and information display.

# CSS Styling:
The CSS file (index.css) styles different elements of the application, including fonts, colors, spacing, and button styles.
It implements both light and dark themes for improved user experience, with appropriate color schemes and transitions.
JavaScript Functionality:
The JavaScript file (index.js) adds interactive functionality to the application, handling user input and manipulating the DOM dynamically.
Functions are implemented for adding workouts and goals, updating water intake, toggling themes, and submitting meal plans.

# Functionalities Implemented:
Workout Tracking: Users can input their workout details, which are then displayed in a list.
Goal Setting: Users can set fitness goals, with duplicate goal prevention implemented to maintain data integrity.
Water Intake Tracking: Users can increase or decrease their water intake, with the current intake displayed.
Theme Toggle: Users can switch between light and dark themes for better readability and user preference.
Meal Plan Submission: Users can submit their weekly meal plans using a form, with a confirmation alert upon submission.

# Project Structure:
The application is structured within a watch-container div, providing a central layout for the content.
Different sections within the container represent various aspects of fitness tracking, such as workouts, goals, water intake, progress charts, theme toggle, and meal planning.

# Reflections:
